Assignment 3 Readme
===================
This program gives you starter code functions to obtain the mean and standard deviation of a population. Your task is to write a function which will calculate the z-score for any item in a given population. 

   *Do not alter the starter functions or define any new ones* (except for testing). Do not call any library methods (other than print()). You may (and will need to) use arithmetic operators. Functions for testing your code are also OK. You may create as many variables as you wish.

   The z-score function is named and has parameters already, but you will need to complete it by writing the code within the function, including the return statement.

   Finally, call the functions with the necessary arguments and compare the results with your expected output.

   You may assume that the given data set will have at least 2 unique real numbers in it.
